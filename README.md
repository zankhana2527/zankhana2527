## About Me

I’m passionate about uncovering insights from data and turning them into meaningful decisions. Currently focused on improving my skills in:

- Python for data cleaning and EDA
- Excel for quick data handling
- Tableau for interactive dashboards

I'm documenting my learning through projects and sharing them here on GitHub.
